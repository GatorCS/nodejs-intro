nodejs-intro
============

This repo contains files for today's session with Node.js. If you clone this repo, you'll get all the files you'll need B-)

What we'll be doing:

You will learn how to create a web application with Node.js. Node.js is pure javascript framework based off of Google Chrome's V8 engine that runs on the server.
Today we'll be configuring a web server, serving up HTML pages with node, and go a little deeper into the framework by creating a chat client with node.

To clone this repo do the following command in the shell (make sure you're in the directory you want your work to be first):

git clone https://github.com/GatorCS/nodejs-intro.git


The command to run the web server locally is the following:

node server.js
